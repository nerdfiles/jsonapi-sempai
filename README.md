# jsonapi-sempai

Sempai wonâ€™t notice me unless sempai can discover me.

Tools for exchange, injection, and migration between Hypermedia Resources 
(ROCA) and Pythonic JSONAPI. Should be able to re-build REST-ful MOVE-style 
architecture components from API `artifact` files, written in JSON following 
HATEOAS principles.

## `artifact` Files

After sempai loads the artifact store, discovery of architecture should take 
place. Naturally, basic CRUD operations should follow from the discovery 
graph. More interesting apps may be discovered from the discoverability 
conditions baked into `jsonapi-sempai`. Cog may assist in the generation 
of APIs for `drf`, et al.
